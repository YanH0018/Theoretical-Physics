This repository contains different artifact types (software, manuscript text, figures, and derived data). To keep things
clear and PRL‑compatible, we apply **scope‑specific licenses**:

- **Software (code, scripts, notebooks)** — MIT License (permissive; SPDX: MIT).
- **Manuscript text & figures** — Creative Commons **CC BY‑NC‑ND 4.0** (non‑commercial, no derivatives; SPDX: CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0).
  This keeps control of the paper’s wording/figures while allowing non‑commercial sharing.
- **Derived numeric datasets you authored** (e.g., CSVs created by you from your own simulations or measurements) — **CC BY 4.0** (SPDX: CC-BY-4.0).
  *Note:* If a dataset is digitized from third‑party figures, include a provenance note; numeric values are facts,
  but respect any reuse limits stated by the original publisher.

Third‑party materials (figures, images, code snippets) remain under their original licenses and are **not** covered here.
If you believe any file is mis‑licensed, please open an issue or contact the author (email in the manuscript).

## 4) File‑type mapping (suggested)

- `/code`, `/scripts`, `/notebooks` → Section 1 (MIT)
- `/paper`, `/figures` (LaTeX, PDFs, EPS/PNG you authored) → Section 2 (CC BY‑NC‑ND 4.0)
- `/data` (CSV you authored) → Section 3 (CC BY 4.0)
- Third‑party content → keep original license in a subfolder README or file header
